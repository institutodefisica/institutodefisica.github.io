### Abstract:

This set of five to six lectures will give an overview of the most common statistical tools
used in astroparticle physics. Both theoretical concepts as well as computational methods
will be covered: You will learn how parameters and parameter errors are estimated and how
signal detections are quantified and reported.
There will be hands-on tutorials with Python after the first lecture. Previous experience with
python is beneficial but not required.

### Outline

Given the limited time, the focus will be on the most common statistical concepts and
methods for astroparticle physics.

* __Lecture 1__: Introduction to data analysis, Poisson likelihood, Nuisance parameters,
profile likelihood and Relation of likelihood to Bayesian statistics (prior and posterior).

* __Lecture 2__: (Python Tutorial): Parameter estimation, confidence intervals, coverage,
Detection (TS, Wilk's theorem). The MINUIT algorithm.

* __Lecture 3__: (Python Tutorial): Monte Carlo methods to estimate parameter errors,
computation (and interpretation) of upper limits and sensitivity.

* __Lecture 4__: (Python Tutorial): Frequentist and Bayesian computational methods:
optimisation, sampling.

* __Lecture 5__: Introduction to the GALPROP and DRAGON codes for numerical modelling.

* __Lecture 6__: (Python tutorial): Propagate Dark Matter yields in the Galaxy with
DRAGON/GALPROP and then test the simulations against available Cosmic Ray and/or
gamma-ray data.
